            <p>舍南舍北皆春水，但见群鸥日日来。
               花径不曾缘客扫，蓬门今始为君开。
               盘飧市远无兼味，樽酒家贫只旧醅。
               肯与邻翁相对饮，隔篱呼取尽馀杯。
            </p>
            <p> To the north and to the south, I see waters of spring all round,<br>
                Yet all that have ever come day after day are waterfowls.<br>
                The footpath has never been swept to a guest receive,<br>
                It's a first to gape open my humble door for a visitor nowadays.<br>
                
                Being far away from town, I have not dishes fit of a feast,<br>
                Being poor, I have only one carafe of stale brew to go around.<br>
                If you don't mind drinking with my neighbour, an old fellow,<br>
                I shall holler across the fence to invite him to share the remaining rounds.

        <p>He's not a cool guy or a capable guy. <br>
            But he was hospitable, and as mentioned above, he will open up his acre and share the drinks with you.

                <h3>Life</h3>
                <p> 
                    He loves movies and travel, and loves to meet all kinds of people. <br>
                    Whenever there is a chance for people to drink together, he feels very happy, <br>
                    but as he grows up, he often laments that the past is gone. <br>
                    He loves adventure and likes to walk around and stop, <br>
                    hoping that his footsteps will never stop!

                <h3>Study</h3>
                <p>He was not a smart man, nor a hard-working man, much less a gritty man. <br>
                    Whenever he sees so many outstanding people around him, <br>
                    such as Jason, Wei, Wenqiao, and Misho, he feels anxious. <br>
                    Like he's writing this web when deadline is comming, 
                    God knows he smoked a few cigarettes. 
                    However, as long as he keep walking, he will always reach the other side, right?

                    But he prefers physical labor to mental work. <br>
                    Maybe this will allow him to exercise his body while making money? <br>
                    I don't know what he thinks. sound......

                     testing, input music and background, and a point recordsystem. 
                     In August of this year, he independently completed a two-dimensional
